# REPT
Rift Engine Planet Toolkit and Kirali Libraries
SOURCE UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, NOTHING IS FINAL

Repository guide:

KIRALI - DLL PACKAGE
Core of the project containing most of the mathematics and computational code.
This DLL is a continuation of the RiftEngine library that will be slowly ported over to its more organized successor.

KIRALICONSOLE - Windows Console App
Test environment for new Kirali features.

REPT - Windows Forms App
Rift Engine Planet Toolbox
Final interface for simulations involving my senior project in college.
This tool will be the C# edition of REPT designed to be a slower introductory tool using the Kirali library to model atmospheric optics of exoplanets.
